Indentation in Python: It is a empty space like white space. In python indentation means the code is belongs to the particular block. It is same as the {} in c/c++.

Example:
if a==10:
  print(a) # added space of indentation it means the block is for if body
else:
  print("No")


Example:

for i in list:
  print(i)
