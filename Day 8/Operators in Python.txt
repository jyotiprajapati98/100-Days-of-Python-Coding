Operators: It is use to perform operations on variables and values.
Operation needed Operators and operand.

Example: sum = a + b # + is operator and a, b is operand.

Types of Operators in Python:
1) Arithmetic Operators:
+, -, *, /, //, %, **.
Example:
val1 = 2
val2 = 3

add = val1 + val2
print(add)

sub = val1 - val2
print(sub)

mul = val1 * val2
print(mul)

div = val1 // val2
print(div)

mod = val1 % val2
print(mod)

expo = val1 ** val2
print(expo)

**************** Output ***********************
5
-1
6
0
2
8


2) Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

3) Logical Operators: and, or, not.

4) Bitwise Operators: OR, AND, XOR, Left Shift, Right Shift.

5) Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, %=, //=, **==, := (for expression calculation).

6) Identity Operators and Membership Operators:

Membership: 
a) IN Operator:
Example:
g in google # True
b in Apple # False

b) Not in:
Example:
a not in google #True

*********** Identity ***************
a) is: The is operator evaluates to True if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object in the memory and false otherwise.
Example:
num1 = 15
num2 = 5

lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = [1, 2, 3]
lst3 = lst1

str1 = "hello world"
str2 = "hello world"

# using 'is' identity operator on different datatypes
print(num1 is num2)
print(lst1 is lst2) #because both the lists refers to different objects in the memory.
print(str1 is str2)
print(str1 is str2)

*********** Output *****************
False
False
True
True

b) is not: The is not operator evaluates True if both variables on the either side of the operator are not the same object in the memory location otherwise it evaluates False.

Example: 

num1 = 15
num2 = 15

lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = [1, 2, 3]
lst3 = lst1

str1 = "hello world"
str2 = "hello world"

# using 'is' identity operator on different datatypes
print(num1 is not num2)
print(lst1 is not lst2) #because both the lists refers to different objects in the memory.
print(str1 is not str2)
print(str1 is not str2)

*************** Output *******************
False
True
False
False
