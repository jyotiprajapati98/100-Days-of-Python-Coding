Polymorphism: Same functions name can be used for different purposed by changing the number of parameters or arguments. The word polymorphism means different forms.

Example:
*Builtin methods:

# len() being used for a string
print(len("geeks"))
# len() being used for a list
print(len([10, 20, 30]))
#Here len() is a buildin function in Python.


*User defined Polymorphism method:
Example:
#user defined polymorphism method

def add(x, y, z = 0): 
    return x + y+z

# Driver code 
print(add(5, 3))
print(add(5, 3, 4))

OUTPUT:
8
12


Polymorphism can be used with different concepts such as:
1) Polymorphism with Classes:
Example:
class India():
    def capital(self):
        print("New Delhi")
    
    def flower(self):
        print("Lotus")

class USA():
    def capital(self):
        print("Washingtan DC")
    
    def flower(self):
        print("Rose")

#create objects
obj_India = India()
obj_Usa = USA()

for country in (obj_India, obj_Usa):
    country.capital()
    country.flower()

******************OUTPUT****************************:
New Delhi
Lotus
Washingtan DC
Rose

2) Polymorphism with Inheritence: Lets define methods with same in parent class and child class. In inheritance the child class inherits the method from parent class. Here child class can modify the inherited method.
Redefining the inherited methods in the class is called as Method Overriding. Here the parameters will be same but the method body is updated.

Example:
class Bird:
  def intro(self):
    print("There are many types of birds.")
    
  def flight(self):
    print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")
  
class sparrow(Bird):
  def flight(self):
    print("Sparrows can fly.")
    
class ostrich(Bird):
  def flight(self):
    print("Ostriches cannot fly.")
    
obj_bird = Bird()
obj_spr = sparrow()
obj_ost = ostrich()

obj_bird.intro()
obj_bird.flight()

obj_spr.intro()
obj_spr.flight()

obj_ost.intro()
obj_ost.flight()

OUTPUT***************

There are many types of birds.
Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.
There are many types of birds.
Sparrows can fly.
There are many types of birds.
Ostriches cannot fly.
