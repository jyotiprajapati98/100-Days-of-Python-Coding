Datatypes in Python: Datatypes are the classification or categorization of the dataset.
.type() function is use to identify the data types.

1) Numeric
Example:
a = 10
print("Type of a :", type(a))

b = 10.5
print("Type of a :", type(b))

c = 10+2j
print("Type of a :", type(c))

Output:
Type of a : <class 'int'>
Type of a : <class 'float'>
Type of a : <class 'complex'>


2) Sequence data types
a) String: Single, double, and triple quotes can be use to write string.
Example:

# Example of different string  types 

String1 = 'Welcome to the World'
print("String with the use of Single Quotes: ")
print(String1)

String1 = "I'm a Jyoti"
print("\nString with the use of Double Quotes: ")
print(String1)

print(type(String1))

String1 = '''I'm a Jyoti'''
print("\nString with the use of Triple Quotes: ")

print(String1)

print(type(String1))

String1 = '''Happy 
            For 
            Life'''
print("\nCreating a multiline String: ")
print(String1)

Output**********************************8

String with the use of Single Quotes: 
Welcome to the World

String with the use of Double Quotes: 
I'm a Jyoti
<class 'str'>

String with the use of Triple Quotes: 
I'm a Jyoti
<class 'str'>

Creating a multiline String: 
Happy 
            For 
            Life


b) List data type: It is same as array in c/c++.
Do not need same data types and store ordered collection of data.

c) Tuple data type: It also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between a tuple and a list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by a tuple class.  

Example:
Tuple1 = ()
print("Initial empty Tuple: ")
print(Tuple1)
Tuple1 = ('Geeks', 'For')
print("\nTuple with the use of String: ")
print(Tuple1)
list1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
print("\nTuple using List: ")
print(tuple(list1))
Tuple1 = tuple('Geeks')
print("\nTuple with the use of function: ")
print(Tuple1)
Tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)
Tuple2 = ('python', 'geek')
Tuple3 = (Tuple1, Tuple2)
print("\nTuple with nested tuples: ")
print(Tuple3)


Output:
Initial empty Tuple: 
()

Tuple with the use of String: 
('Geeks', 'For')

Tuple using List: 
(1, 2, 4, 5, 6)

Tuple with the use of function: 
('G', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's')

Tuple with nested tuples: 
((0, 1, 2, 3), ('python', 'geek'))
