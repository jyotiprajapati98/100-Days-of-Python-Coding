Encapsulation: It is a concept of wrapping data and object in one unit called class.
It puts restrictions on the access of the variables and methods that can directly prevent the accidental modifications.
Like a private variable cannot access by the outer classes or methods.

Types of member access:
Private
Protected
Public

Private Members: Members with double underscores (__) are private. They are intended to be accessed only within the class where they are defined. Python uses name mangling to make these members harder to access from outside the class.

Protected Members: Members with a single underscore (_) are protected. They are intended for use within the class and its subclasses. This is a convention and does not enforce strict access control.
