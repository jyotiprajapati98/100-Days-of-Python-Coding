Destructors: It called when an object get destroyed. It is not needed much in Python because python has automatic garbade collector for memory management.

Syntax:
def __del__(self):
  #body

Example:
# Python program to illustrate destructor
class Employee:

	# Initializing
	def __init__(self):
		print('Employee created.')
		
	def __del__(self):
	    print('destructor called and Employee is deleted')
	    
#create object of the class
obj = Employee()

#delete the object with del name, it automatically invoke
del obj

#because it is delete
#print(obj)


OUTPUT: 
Employee created.
destructor called and Employee is deleted
